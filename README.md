INDUSTRIAL DEFECT DETECTION 

INTRODUCTION: 
        Industrial defect detection is a crucial process in manufacturing to ensure product quality and reduce waste. This project uses OpenCV-based image processing techniques to automatically identify surface defects such as scratches, holes, or dents in product images. It provides a simple, efficient, and cost-effective solution for visual inspection without relying on complex machine learning models.



ABSTRACT: 

The goal of this project is to create a basic but effective system that detects defects in industrial product images using image processing techniques. The system processes the input image through various stages such as grayscale conversion, noise reduction, and thresholding, and then applies contour detection to identify and highlight defective regions. This approach is ideal for spotting surface-level defects such as scratches, dents, or holes. The resulting output image visually marks the defected areas, facilitating automated quality control in industrial environments. 



OBJECTIVES: 

➢	To detect and highlight defect areas in an input image using image processing  techniques. 

➢	To filter out irrelevant regions based on size and only mark valid defects. 

➢	To build a basic defect detection system using OpenCV. 



 FEATURES: 

1.Automatic defect detection: Identifies dark defect regions in the image. 

2.Noise reduction: Gaussian blur reduces unwanted noise before analysis. 

3.Size-based filtering: Eliminates false positives by ignoring contours that are too small or too large. 

4.Bounding box and label: Marks the detected defect with a red rectangle and label. 

5.Visualization: Displays the final output with defects highlighted. 



METHODOLOGY: 

The defect detection process follows these key steps: 

1.Image Acquisition: Capture images of industrial components using a highresolution camera in a controlled environment. 

2.Preprocessing: Convert images to grayscale, apply Gaussian blur, and use thresholding to remove noise and highlight significant features. 

3.Contour Detection: Use OpenCV functions to detect edges and contours representing possible defects. 

4.Defect Identification: Analyse shape, size, and pattern of contours to determine deviations from the standard reference. 

5.Classification (Optional): Defects may be classified using rule-based logic or machine learning techniques depending on severity and type. 

6.Visualization and Reporting: Display results by marking detected defects and generating reports for analysis. 



EXISTING WORK: 

1.Manual Inspection: Traditional visual inspection by human operators is timeconsuming, inconsistent, and error-prone. 

2.Basic Computer Vision Systems: Early systems used simple thresholding and edge detection but struggled with varying lighting and complex surfaces. 

3.Machine Learning Approaches: Systems using SVMs, KNN, and decision trees have improved accuracy but require extensive feature engineering. 

4.Deep Learning Models: CNN-based models like YOLO and ResNet have been employed for real-time, high-accuracy detection, but demand significant computational resources and large datasets.

 USAGES: 

1.Place an image named defect.jpg in the same directory as the script.
